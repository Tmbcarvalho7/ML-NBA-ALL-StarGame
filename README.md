*Machine Learning for NBA All-Star Game selection*

This project was conducted as part of the ”Aprendizagem Computacional” 
course in the first year of the Master’s
degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at FEUP. The
main objective is to develop a machine learning model to predict
NBA All-Star selections based on players’ performance statistics.
The dataset comprises various player metrics, including points,
rebounds, and assists. Initial data exploration and preprocessing
encompass handling missing values, converting formats, and
grouping statistics by year. Exploratory data analysis provides
valuable insights into trends and patterns in player performance
over the years. A correlation analysis is performed to identify
significant features for predicting All-Star selections. The ulti-
mate goal of the project is to deliver a robust model capable of
identifying potential All-Star players based on their performance
metrics.
